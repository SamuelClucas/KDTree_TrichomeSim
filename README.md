# kDTree Legacy Project
This tiny repo is my first ever project written in C++ during my month-long internship in the Nédélec group at the [Sainsbury Laboratory in Cambridge](https://www.slcu.cam.ac.uk/) (2023).

## Overview:
This took place in the summer interim between my 2nd and 3rd year of my undergrad. I began to develop a curiosity for computational thinking and was looking for ways it could be used in biological disciplines. 

### Goal:
- Write my own KD-tree implementation (datastructure and NNS) 
I had a particular interest in pointers. This code is not necessarily computationally-oriented or wisely designed.

### Rationale:
My post-doc supervisor was developing 'Trichomsim', a computational model of a plant trichome cell

The simulation featured a 3D mesh point cloud with thousands of points, making for an inefficient brute-force NNS.

This was an avenue explored for the sake of its optimisation.

## Outcomes:
I presented an [academic poster](./academic_poster.pdf) at the Gatbsy Plant Science conference, Oxford (September 2023).

## Funding:
I secured funding for this internship from [The Gatsby Charitable Foundation](https://www.gatsby.org.uk/plant-science/programmes/sainsbury-undergraduate-studentships).
